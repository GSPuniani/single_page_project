                <h2>Primer on F1</h2>
                
				<p>Due to its high-risk nature, F1 is prone to many collisions, some of which can be fatal. In fact, 
                    astronaut Scott Kelly observed that F1 drivers are about as likely to die from 
                    occupational hazards as astronauts.

                    The 2020 season is currently in session after a delay due to the COVID-19 pandemic, so 
                    races can be streamed on ESPN+ or other services that offer live sports. A great documentary 
                    series chronicling the 2018 and 2019 seasons is currently available on Netflix; it is 
                    called <i>F1: Drive to Survive</i>. There are also other documentary films about key 
                    figures in F1 history, such as the film <i>Senna</i> about legendary driver Ayrton Senna. 
                    Additionally, there is a fantastic Hollywood film called <i>Rush</i> from director Ron 
                    Howard about the rivalry between drivers James Hunt and Nikki Lauda in the 1970's.

                <h2>F1 Racecar Technology</h2>
                <p>Modern F1 cars are designed, in a way, to be kind of like the opposite of 
                    aircraft. Formula 1 cars attain such incredibly high speeds that the they could generate 
                    their own lift force, like airplanes speeding up before takeoff. Thus, F1 engineers 
                    design the cars so that the rear wings generate "downward lift" so that the car 
                    maintains grip on the track.

					<h2>Circuits</h2>
					<p>Formula 1 races take place all over the world. In fact, there is at least one F1 
                        circuit on 6 of the 7 continents of the world (no races are held in Antarctica).
