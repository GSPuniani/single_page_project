                    Formula One (F1) is the highest class of single-seat automobile racing that is sanctioned by the Fédération 
                    Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA). 
                </p>
                <p>
                    A typical season consists of 21 Grands Prix, but this season will only consist of 17 
                    Grands Prix as a result of an irregular schedule due the COVID-19 pandemic. 
                    Each Grand Prix consists of three races spread out over a weekend on a circuit. Friday is devoted solely 
                    to practice laps so that drivers can familiarize themselves with the track. Qualifying sessions are held 
                    on Saturday. These sessions determine grid positions for the actual race on Sunday, so faster lap times 
                    earn drivers higher grid positions. The highest grid position is closest to the starting line, and it is 
                    known as <q>pole position</q>. The real race is held on Sunday, and the final places determine the number 
                    of points earned for the driver and his team. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    The World Champion is determined by the racer who has accumulated the most points 
                    for the season. The points breakdown per race is as follows:

                    The 2020 season is currently back in session after a significant delay due to the COVID-19 pandemic, so 
                    races can be streamed on ESPN+ or other services that offer live sports. An excellent documentary 
                    series chronicling the 2018 and 2019 seasons is currently available on Netflix; it is 
                    called <i>Formula 1: Drive to Survive</i>. There are also other documentary films about key 
                    figures in F1 history, such as the film <i>Senna</i> about legendary driver Ayrton Senna. 
                    Additionally, there is a fantastic Hollywood film from director Ron 
                    Howard called <i>Rush</i> about the rivalry between drivers James Hunt and Niki Lauda in the 1970's. Current 
                    World Champion Lewis Hamilton also appeared in an episode of the Netflix series <q>My Next Guest Needs No Introduction with 
                    David Letterman</q> for a long-form interview about his life.

                    <h2>Teams and Drivers</h2>

                    <p>
                        Below is a list of the 10 teams competing in the 2020 season. The colloquial name 
                        is included in parentheses next to the official team name. Each team has two drivers. 
                        F1 is unique among other sports in that teammates are direct competitors with each other. In 
                        fact, because teammates use the same car, teammates compete more against each other than 
                        against other racers because they can be directly compared against the performance of a 
                        teammate. Teams that have better resources (such as Mercedes and Ferrari) can often perform 
                        better without necessarily having the best drivers (although they often do) because their cars 
                        are usually engineered better. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Also included below for each team is the team chief, whose role is very similar to that of a 
                        head coach in other sports.

                        <p>Current ranking: 1st place (190 points)</p>
                        <p>Lewis Hamilton is the dominant F1 driver of this generation. He has already won 
                            6 world championships, putting him in the category of the all-time greats among the 
                            likes of Sir Jackie Stewart, Ayrton Senna, and Michael Schumacher. Hamilton has amassed 
                            3,621 points since making his fiery F1 debut in 2007. He has achieved 158 podium finishes 
                            (placing 1st, 2nd, or 3rd in a race) so far.

                        <p>
                            Valtteri Bottas is considered a "points machine" because of his impressive ability to consistently 
                            rack up points, although he often has trouble claiming full victories. This is partly due to 
                            his teammate, Lewis Hamilton, who has won an impressive 90 races in his career. There is no doubt 
                            that Bottas has rightfully earned his highly coveted seat at Mercedes, but he has remained under Hamilton's 
                            shadow during the time that they have both been on the team.

                        <p>
                            Max Verstappen is an F1 prodigy born into a racing family. He is the son of a former Formula 1 driver (his 
                            father) and a former karting racer (his mother). Verstappen entered the sport of F1 
                            as its youngest racer, at a mere 17 years old. In 2016, he became the youngest race winner 
                            (on top of his record of being the youngest points earner in F1) when he won 1st place 
                            in Barcelona at the age of 18 years and 228 days. He usually leads the middle of the pack, 
                            but he often goes toe-to-toe with frequent winners Mercedes and Ferrari.

                        <h2>F1 Racecar Technology</h2>
                        <p>
                            Modern Formula One cars attain such incredibly high speeds that the they could generate 
                            their own lift force, like airplanes speeding up on a runway before takeoff. Engineers 
                            design F1 cars so that the rear wings generate "downward lift" so that the car 
                            maintains grip on the track. Since F1 cars undergo rigorous physical strain on the track from 
                            rapid acceleration and deceleration, sharp turns, intense G-forces, and other mechanical stressors, 
                            engineers must think beyond traditional automobile design and seek inspiration from jet aircraft and 
                            other high-speed machines.

                        <p>Formula 1 races take place all over the world. In fact, there is at least one F1 
                            circuit on each of 6 of the 7 continents of the world during a regular season. 
                            However, the delayed start to the F1 season this year has completely upended the standard race schedule. 
                            In a normal season, there are 21 Grands Prix. In this season, there will only be 17. Some of the usual circuits 
                            have been added or removed from last season's line-up. Below is a list of this season's
