                    The 2020 season is currently back in session after a delay due to the COVID-19 pandemic, so 
                    races can be streamed on ESPN+ or other services that offer live sports. A great documentary 
                    series chronicling the 2018 and 2019 seasons is currently available on Netflix; it is 
                    called <i>F1: Drive to Survive</i>. There are also other documentary films about key 
                    figures in F1 history, such as the film <i>Senna</i> about legendary driver Ayrton Senna. 
                    Additionally, there is a fantastic Hollywood film called <i>Rush</i> from director Ron 
                    Howard about the rivalry between drivers James Hunt and Nikki Lauda in the 1970's.

            <!-- List the 10 teams and 20 drivers (2 drivers per team) -->
            <section id="teams-drivers">
                <h2>Teams and Drivers</h2>
                <p>
                    Below is a list of the 10 teams competing in the 2020 season. The colloquial name 
                    is included in parentheses next to the official team name. Each team has two drivers. 
                    F1 is unique among other sports in that teammates are direct competitors with each other. In 
                    fact, because teammates use the same car, teammates compete more against each other than 
                    against other racers because they can be directly compared against the performance of a 
                    teammate. Teams that have better resources (such as Mercedes and Ferrari) can often perform 
                    better without necessarily having the best drivers (although they often do) because their cars 
                    are usually engineered better. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Also included below for each team is the team chief, whose role is very similar to that of a 
                    head coach in other sports.

                        <p>Current ranking: 1st place (190 points)</p>
                        <p>Lewis Hamilton is the dominant F1 driver of this generation. He has already won 
                            6 world championships, so he has essentially cemented his status as 
                            one of the greats among the likes of Sir Jackie Stewart, Ayrton Senna, and 
                            Michael Schumacher. Hamilton has amassed 3,621 points since making his fiery rookie debut in 
                            2007. He has achieved 158 podium finishes so far.

                        <p>
                            Valtteri Bottas is considered a "points machine" because of his impressive ability to consistently 
                            rack up points, although he often has trouble claiming full victories. This is partly due to 
                            his teammate, Lewis Hamilton, who has won an impressive 90 races in his career. There is no doubt 
                            that Bottas has rightfully earned his highly coveted seat at Mercedes, but he has remained under Hamilton's 
                            shadow ever since he joined that team.

                        <p>
                            Max Verstappen is a racing prodigy, and is the son of a former Formula 1 driver (his 
                            father) and a former karting racer (his mother). Verstappen entered the sport of F1 
                            as its youngest racer, at a mere 17 years old. In 2016, he became the youngest race winner 
                            (on top of his record of being the youngest points earner in F1) when he won 1st place 
                            in Barcelona at the age of 18 years and 228 days. He usually leads the middle of the pack, 
                            but he often goes toe-to-toe with frequent winners Mercedes and Ferrari.

                <h2>F1 Racecar Technology</h2>
                <p>Modern F1 cars are designed, in a way, to be kind of like the opposite of 
                    aircraft. Formula 1 cars attain such incredibly high speeds that the they could generate 
                    their own lift force, like airplanes speeding up before takeoff. Thus, F1 engineers 
                    design the cars so that the rear wings generate "downward lift" so that the car 
                    maintains grip on the track.

                <h2>Circuits</h2>
                <p>Formula 1 races take place all over the world. In fact, there is at least one F1 
                    circuit on each of 6 of the 7 continents of the world during a regular season. 
                    However, the delayed start to the F1 season this year has shifted the race schedule. 
                    In a normal season, there are 21 Grands Prix. This season, there are only 17. Some of the circuits 
                    have been added or removed from last season's line-up. Below is a list of this season's 
                    circuits, in chronological order.
